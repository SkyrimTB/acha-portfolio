## Features

- **Three** levels of increasing difficulty and size
- Player movement using **W, A, S, D** keys
- Randomly generated coins to **collect**
- Randomly generated fires to **avoid**
- Healing items that appear **every 5 rounds**
- Step **counter** to keep track of player's moves
- **Game over** when player's HP reaches zero
- Option to **restart** the game after game over
- **Colorful ASCII** art for game elements

## C++ Features Used

The Coin Collector game project utilizes several modern C++ features, including:

1. **Move Semantics**: Efficiently transfers ownership of resources using move constructors and assignment operators in the `GameRunner` class.

2. **RAII**: RAII stands for **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**, it manages resources by ensuring proper initialization and cleanup in the `GameRunner` class.

3. **Templates**: Creates a generic `GameRunner` class templated on the type of game board elements for flexibility and reusability.

4. **Concurrency**: Handles the game loop and user input simultaneously using separate threads (`std::jthread`).

5. **Lambdas**: Uses lambda expressions for concise and inline functionality, such as filtering game board positions.

6. **std::barrier**: Coordinates the execution of game loop and input processing threads to ensure synchronization.

7. **std::format**: Provides type-safe string formatting for output messages.

8. **std::ranges**: Performs operations on ranges of elements, aiding in the placement of game objects.

## Requirements

- C++20 compiler
- CMake 3.12 or higher

## How to Play

- Use the W, A, S, D keys to move the player up, left, down, and right, respectively.
- Collect coins to increase your score and progress to the next level.
- Avoid touching the fires, as they will decrease your HP.
- Collect healing items (H) to restore your HP.
- Press 'q' to quit the game at any time.
- Press 'r' to restart the game at any time.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `GameRunner.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the `GameRunner` class.
- `GameRunner.cpp`: Implementation file for the `GameRunner` class, containing the game logic and mechanics.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the program, creates an instance of `GameRunner` and starts the game.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake configuration file for building the project.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following C++ features and libraries:

- C++20 standard library
- `<thread>` for multi-threading support
- `<chrono>` for time-related functionality
- `<format>` for string formatting (C++20 feature)
- `<barrier>` for thread synchronization (C++20 feature)
- `<ranges>` for range-based operations (C++20 feature)
