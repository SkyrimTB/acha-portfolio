## FORWORD

I truly appreciate **Alex K** and his work **In Pursuit of Better Levels**, I cannot start my level design without this. This map is designed according to the competitive mode of Valorant, it should meet most gameplay scenarios of Valorant.

I collaborated with two friends, [Tom Tang](https://ttang.design/) from NEU and [Teri](https://www.google.com) from ACCD. We three all are crazy lover of Valorant, which leads us here.

## CONCEPT DESIGN

### IDEATION

Sydney, where I spent 4 years for my undergraduate study here, is a lovely harbour city. Apart from Sydney Opera House, Sydney is also famous as his harbor, the most representative one is Darling Harbour.

The most unique thing in Darling Harbour is the brigde, it is the oldest electrical swing span bridge in the world. This will be the core design of Sea Harbour.

Harbour will be the core of the map, unlike other maps, it will both be the mid road and the shortcut of A site and B site. The map will be divided into two parts, the outer part will be the loading deck and the inner part will be the warehouse.

### MAP NARRITIVE

**Background**

In a world where the boundaries of reality and technology blur, the battle for control over advanced tech rages on. Valorant Protocol, a covert organization dedicated to maintaining global stability, has identified a new hotbed of conflict: Sea Harbour, a strategic location in Sydney, Australia.

**The Conflict**

Sea Harbour's strategic importance lies in its role as a crucial transport and storage hub for Radiant technology. The Swing Span Bridge, a marvel of engineering, is rumored to house a secret facility containing advanced Radiant tech that both Valorant Protocol and Kingdom Corporation covet.

The battle begins as both factions arrive at the harbour under the cover of darkness. Brimstone leads his team through the bustling loading deck, while Viper's forces infiltrate the inner warehouse.
