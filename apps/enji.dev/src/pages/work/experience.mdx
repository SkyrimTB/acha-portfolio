As an MSCS student, a former esports pro player and a crazy geek, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to the technology, entertainment and gaming fields. I enjoy collaborating with diverse and talented teams.

"One of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there", this is what Steve Jobs said, and what I will always believe.
